~Nurturing Homegrown Enterprise ~

We empower local entrepreneurs by providing the tools and human capital required to operate and grow their business. Our operation model relies on intense investment of operational assets and connections with human capital in order for entrepreneurs to build capacity and scale.
Local enterprise is a way of stimulating the economy, activities of entrepreneurship are known to create not only profits to the business operators and shareholders, but also pay tax, while creating employment which leads to more tax collected by the government. 
In Zambia, despite the clear benefits that local enterprises bring to the economy in terms of generating profits, taxes, and employment, many entrepreneurs struggle to access the necessary funding to start or expand their businesses. Traditional financial institutions often cite reasons such as lack of compliance and record-keeping, as well as the absence of collateral, as barriers to extending financing to local startups. This gap in funding not only hinders the growth potential of individual businesses but also stifles overall economic development.
